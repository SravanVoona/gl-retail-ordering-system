Steps to get regalia working locally:

Codebase:
--> Clone git project: https://github.com/SravanVoona/gl-retail-ordering-system.git
--> Branch: https://github.com/SravanVoona/gl-retail-ordering-system/tree/Version0_Develop

Installations:
--> Install mysql server and create "regalia" database
--> Go to fe-be folder
       ---> run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
--> Go to Recommendation services
       ---> run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
--> Install mongodb server  (on windows the mongodb service is started by default)
--> Go to bidding_engine folder
       ---> run "pip install -r requirements.txt"


Config changes: Ensure the local connection code is uncommented and remote is commented in both below config files
--> Go to fe-be folder
       ---> Change config.yaml file to add mysql account details like password, host etc. 
--> Go to bidding_engine folder
       ---> Change config.yaml file and make mongodb connection string if needed -not needed in most of the cases (You could use default conn string - connection_string: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/')

 
Downloads:
--> Go to Recommendation Service folder
      ---> Go through readme file to download cosine_sim.sav file and save it in the same folder
(you can also use the the cosine_sim.sav from "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VKvjfM65sQMoR5x26QLZV5P6kw_aZi3x")

Creating tables in the database:
---> Go to fe-be/ecommerce folder 
       ---> run "python run.py"
Verify from SQL workbench that the tables are created in the regalia database (ensure refresh is done)

Data Input:
--> Go to fe-be/ecommerce folder
       ---> Copy contents of "regalia_data_input.sql" and put on a mysql workbench query window and execute it
	
Running the Application:
---> Go to bidding_engine folder 
       ---> run "python run.py"
Open browser to http://192.168.29.6:7200/
You should see "Running Bidding Service" on the screen
---> Go to Recommendation Services folder
       ---> run "uvicorn app1:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"
Open browser to http://localhost:8000/ 
You should see "{"GFG Example":"FastAPI"}" on the screen

---> Go to ecommerce folder 
       ---> run "python run.py"
Open browser to http://localhost:5000/ 
This will open the application and you should see the home screen

To access Seller page, logout of the home screen and http://localhost:5000/seller
To access Admin page, http://localhost:5000/admin. You need to be an admin to access admin functions. For now, this has to be a backend table update: user.isadmin=1
